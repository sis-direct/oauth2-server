`league/oauth2-server` is a a standards compliant implementation of an [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) authorization server written in PHP which makes working with OAuth 2.0 trivial. You can easily configure an OAuth 2.0 server to protect your API with access tokens, or allow clients to request new access tokens and refresh them.

It supports out of the box the following grants:

* Authorization code grant
* Implicit grant
* Client credentials grant
* Resource owner password credentials grant
* Refresh grant

The following RFCs are implemented:

* [RFC6749 "OAuth 2.0"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
* [RFC6750 " The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750)
* [RFC7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
* [RFC7636 "Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

This library was created by Alex Bilbie. Find him on Twitter at [@alexbilbie](https://twitter.com/alexbilbie).
